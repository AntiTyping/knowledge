    "utterance": "What is JWT?",
    "response": "JSON Web Token is a JSON-based open standard (RFC 7519) for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim \"logged in as admin\" and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as admin. The tokens are signed by the server's key, so the client and server are both able to verify that the token is legitimate. The tokens are designed to be compact, URL-safe and usable especially in web browser single sign-on (SSO) context. JWT claims can be typically used to pass identity of authenticated users between an identity provider and a service provider, or any other type of claims as required by business processes. The tokens can also be authenticated and encrypted."
